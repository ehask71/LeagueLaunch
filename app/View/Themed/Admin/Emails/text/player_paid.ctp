Hello <?php echo $player[0][parent_name];?>,
        
   This is <?php echo $leaguename;?> please disregard the previous email regarding 
your players being unpaid. We had a typo and it went out to all registered players 
not just players that were unpaid. If you are receiving this your player (<?php echo $player[0][player_name];?>)
is marked paid.

Sorry for any confusion.
 

Thank You,
East Bay
